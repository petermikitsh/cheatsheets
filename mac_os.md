# Mac OS

## Always Show Scrollbars

Enabling this setting is helpful for spotting duplicate, nested scrollbars in HTML documents when `overflow: scroll;` is set (`overflow: auto` is preferred).

- Click the Apple menu at the top-left of the screen, then select System Preferences.
- Next, select the General preferences pane; it’s the very first one, up at the top.
- Under the “Show scroll bars” heading, you’ll find three options: “Automatically based on input device,” “When scrolling,” and “Always.”
- Go ahead and select that last “Always” option. You’re done!
